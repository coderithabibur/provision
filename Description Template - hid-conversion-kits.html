<h4><font size="-1"><span><strong>Standard Slim HID Conversion Kits.</strong></span></font></h4>
<p>The Standard Slim HID Kits are perfect for those on a budget or who need brighter lights at a lower price.<br>
They are available in 35w or 55w and are compatible with 12v or 24v systems, (they are a 9-32v AC/DC Ballast).<br>
35w is equal in brighness to a 150w halogen but uses 50% power and lasts 10x longer than standard 55w halogen bulbs.<br>
55w is equal in brighness to a 225w halogen and uses the same amount of power as a standard 55w halogen bulb, but lasts 10x longer.<br><br>
All our bulbs are a "True Colour" HID Bulb which gives a more pure colour temperature, the same as you would find on a high end BMW, Mercedes, Or Audi. The bulbs are also UV Cut Quartz and will not damage, burn, or warp lenses and reflectors.<br>
The ballasts in the standard slim have a 3yr warranty and the bulbs have a life of around 3500hrs, but generally bulbs and ballasts will last around 5yrs or more.<br><br>
