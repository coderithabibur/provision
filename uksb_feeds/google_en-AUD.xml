<link><![CDATA[https://www.pro-vision-lighting.com/45-inch-led-light-bar-pro-series-parabolic?language=en&amp;currency=AUD]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[45 Professional Grade, Heavy Duty LED Light Bars with Precision Reflector Lenses.The Pro Series LED Light Bars have some unique features making them one of the most popular and attractive choice for savvy buyers.Mulit-Bracket Mounting System.Having the ability to adjust the rigid side mounts gives the fitter the option to extend the length of the light bar to suit the mounting placement and not have to worry about if the lightbar is too long or too short.The Pro Series also come with 360 deg. rotational L Foot side mount brackets for mounting in different positions in grills, on bars, or on roofs, and they also come with base mounts on a sliding rail for easy fitting to bull bars with pre-existing mounting holes.Reflectors.Advanced engineering in the parabolic reflectors give you an intense, but evenly spread, beam of light, and they are available in an All Spot, All Flood , or a Combination Beam of Spot + Flood , making them versatile for a wide range of uses. Weatherproofing and Environmental Protection.The Pro Series Light Bars are IP68 Ingress rated for complete water and dust proofing, have advanced thermal management for protection of critical systems in high and low temperatures, are UV Rated and comprise MAR Paint Technology so that they will last for years in the Australian sun without flaking or fading, they have Military Breathers for pressure equalization in high and low altitudes, and High Vibration Resistance - 15Grms 24-2000hz, Shock: 12G-8hrs Non-Stop Logarithmic Testing for harsh environments.The Pro Series Light Bars are a stylish and heavy duty light bar that are just as comfortable driving on long dark highways in your late model car, or for off-road 4x4 adventure enthusiasts, or for on work machines in the mining and farming industry. On or Off the road the Pro Series LED Light Bars will give you 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed.45 Inch LED Light Bar Information for those who need to know the ins-and-outs and every little detail.There is a massive amount of information you can learn about light-bars. I will go over some common questions below, but if you need more specific information on your light bar queries call us in Australia on +61 (2) 9698 2543.What about the set-up if i want to hook them up to come on with the high beams?You can get high beam adapters for the light bars from us free of charge, just let us know you need them, but...because electrical systems vary so much with so many different types of vehicles on the market, we suggest getting an auto electrician to fit the light bar for you and let them make up their own switching connections, for your particular vehicle. Why? because if you get standard adapters, say, for a H4 connector, the adapter may not work properly if you have a negatively switched vehicle, or other types of electrical systems, this is why it s always best to get your light bar fitted by a professional who has fitted led light bars previously.Whats the best type of lens configuration in the 45 Inch?Ok, so this is a biggie, as the old saying goes, horses for courses , in saying that, this Pro Series Light Bar is probably the highest quality universal light bar i have personally seen that doesn t cost an arm and leg, and you can pretty much configure them to get distance, width, and depth.These days you are getting Hybrid lenses that have optical and parabolic properties, but you also have to take into account the type of led that is being used, as the led s themselves have specific optical directional properties, so in other words, simply putting the brightest led you can buy into your light bar does not mean you are going to get the most out of them, the lenses must work in conjunction with the type of led to get the best result.Why do some light bars interfere with the radio?One of the reasons that lightbars interfere with radios is because radios can be earthed on the body, and some led light bars are mounted on the body and therefore the radio picks up electromagnetic interference from them through the earth.A couple of solutions is to either make sure your light-bars components are shielded so as not to give off electromagnetic interference, (which are Pro Series have), or make sure your lights are shielded where you mount them.I have also seen where radios are earthed in the same vein as the headlights, so they can pick up the interference through the system.This is generally only affecting AM stations, and you will find that that it can increase the noise the further away from towns you get.You can also use radio suppressors on cabling lines, or use EMC decoders, (little match box size suppressors you can add to your cabling.In most cases, a good quality led light bar will have built-in EMC so you won t get this problem, but on some older vehicles, you might find a few problems you have to deal with.Call us for free advice about fitting led light-bars to your Car, Truck, Motorcycle, or Quad bike. We have the expertise and solutions to give you the righ]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[34 Professional Grade, Heavy Duty LED Light Bars with Precision Reflector Lenses. The Pro Series LED Light Bars have some unique features making them one of the most popular and attractive choice for savvy buyers.Mulit-Bracket Mounting System.Having the ability to adjust the rigid side mounts gives the fitter the option to extend the length of the light bar to suit the mounting placement and not have to worry about if the lightbar is too long or too short.The Pro Series also come with 360 deg. rotational L Foot side mount brackets for mounting in different positions in grills, on bars, or on roofs, and they also come with base mounts on a sliding rail for easy fitting to bull bars with pre-existing mounting holes.Reflectors.Advanced engineering in the parabolic reflectors give you an intense, but evenly spread, beam of light, and they are available in an All Spot, All Flood , or a Combination Beam of Spot + Flood , making them versatile for a wide range of uses. Weatherproofing and Environmental Protection.The Pro Series Light Bars are IP68 Ingress rated for complete water and dust proofing, have advanced thermal management for protection of critical systems in high and low temperatures, are UV Rated and comprise MAR Paint Technology so that they will last for years in the Australian sun without flaking or fading, they have Military Breathers for pressure equalization in high and low altitudes, and High Vibration Resistance - 15Grms 24-2000hz, Shock: 12G-8hrs Non-Stop Logarithmic Testing for harsh environments.The Pro Series Light Bars are a stylish and heavy duty light bar that are just as comfortable driving on long dark highways in your late model car, or for off-road 4x4 adventure enthusiasts, or for on work machines in the mining and farming industry. On or Off the road the Pro Series LED Light Bars will give you 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed. 34 Inch LED Light Bar Information for those who need to know the ins-and-outs and every little detail. There is a massive amount of information you can learn about light-bars. I will go over some common questions below, but if you need more specific information on your light bar queries call us in Australia on +61 (2) 9698 2543. What about the set-up if i want to hook them up to come on with the high beams? You can get high beam adapters for the light bars from us free of charge, just let us know you need them, but...because electrical systems vary so much with so many different types of vehicles on the market, we suggest getting an auto electrician to fit the light bar for you and let them make up their own switching connections, for your particular vehicle. Why? because if you get standard adapters, say, for a H4 connector, the adapter may not work properly if you have a negatively switched vehicle, or other types of electrical systems, this is why it s always best to get your light bar fitted by a professional who has fitted led light bars previously. Whats the best type of lens configuration in the 34 Inch? Ok, so this is a biggie, as the old saying goes, horses for courses , in saying that, this Pro Series Light Bar is probably the highest quality universal light bar i have personally seen that doesn t cost an arm and leg, and you can pretty much configure them to get distance, width, and depth.These days you are getting Hybrid lenses that have optical and parabolic properties, but you also have to take into account the type of led that is being used, as the led s themselves have specific optical directional properties, so in other words, simply putting the brightest led you can buy into your light bar does not mean you are going to get the most out of them, the lenses must work in conjunction with the type of led to get the best result. Why do some light bars interfere with the radio? One of the reasons that lightbars interfere with radios is because radios can be earthed on the body, and some led light bars are mounted on the body and therefore the radio picks up electromagnetic interference from them through the earth.A couple of solutions is to either make sure your light-bars components are shielded so as not to give off electromagnetic interference, (which are Pro Series have), or make sure your lights are shielded where you mount them.I have also seen where radios are earthed in the same vein as the headlights, so they can pick up the interference through the system.This is generally only affecting AM stations, and you will find that that it can increase the noise the further away from towns you get.You can also use radio suppressors on cabling lines, or use EMC decoders, (little match box size suppressors you can add to your cabling.In most cases, a good quality led light bar will have built-in EMC so you won t get this problem, but on some older vehicles, you might find a few problems you have to deal with.

<description><![CDATA[50 Professional Grade, Heavy Duty LED Light Bars with Precision Reflector Lenses.The Pro Series LED Light Bars have some unique features making them one of the most popular and attractive choice for savvy buyers.Mulit-Bracket Mounting System.Having the ability to adjust the rigid side mounts gives the fitter the option to extend the length of the light bar to suit the mounting placement and not have to worry about if the lightbar is too long or too short.The Pro Series also come with 360 deg. rotational L Foot side mount brackets for mounting in different positions in grills, on bars, or on roofs, and they also come with base mounts on a sliding rail for easy fitting to bull bars with pre-existing mounting holes.LED s.Premium Grade High Intensity LED s are also a feature of the Pro Series, they produce 170lm/w, and have a lifespan of 100,000hrs, without and significant illumination degradation.Reflectors.Advanced engineering in the parabolic reflectors give you an intense, but evenly spread, beam of light, and they are available in an All Spot, All Flood , or a Combination Beam of Spot + Flood , making them versatile for a wide range of uses. Weatherproofing and Environmental Protection.The Pro Series Light Bars are IP68 Ingress rated for complete water and dust proofing, have advanced thermal management for protection of critical systems in high and low temperatures, are UV Rated and comprise MAR Paint Technology so that they will last for years in the Australian sun without flaking or fading, they have Military Breathers for pressure equalization in high and low altitudes, and High Vibration Resistance - 15Grms 24-2000hz, Shock: 12G-8hrs Non-Stop Logarithmic Testing for harsh environments.The Pro Series Light Bars are a stylish and heavy duty light bar that are just as comfortable driving on long dark highways in your late model car, or for off-road 4x4 adventure enthusiasts, or for on work machines in the mining and farming industry. On or Off the road the Pro Series LED Light Bars will give you 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed.50 Inch LED Light Bar Information for those who need to know the ins-and-outs and every little detail.There is a massive amount of information you can learn about light-bars. I will go over some common questions below, but if you need more specific information on your light bar queries call us in Australia on +61 (2) 9698 2543.What about the set-up if i want to hook them up to come on with the high beams?You can get high beam adapters for the light bars from us free of charge, just let us know you need them, but...because electrical systems vary so much with so many different types of vehicles on the market, we suggest getting an auto electrician to fit the light bar for you and let them make up their own switching connections, for your particular vehicle. Why? because if you get standard adapters, say, for a H4 connector, the adapter may not work properly if you have a negatively switched vehicle, or other types of electrical systems, this is why it s always best to get your light bar fitted by a professional who has fitted led light bars previously.Whats the best type of lens configuration in the 50 Inch?Ok, so this is a biggie, as the old saying goes, horses for courses , in saying that, this Pro Series Light Bar is probably the highest quality universal light bar i have personally seen that doesn t cost an arm and leg, and you can pretty much configure them to get distance, width, and depth.These days you are getting Hybrid lenses that have optical and parabolic properties, but you also have to take into account the type of led that is being used, as the led s themselves have specific optical directional properties, so in other words, simply putting the brightest led you can buy into your light bar does not mean you are going to get the most out of them, the lenses must work in conjunction with the type of led to get the best result.Why do some light bars interfere with the radio?One of the reasons that lightbars interfere with radios is because radios can be earthed on the body, and some led light bars are mounted on the body and therefore the radio picks up electromagnetic interference from them through the earth.A couple of solutions is to either make sure your light-bars components are shielded so as not to give off electromagnetic interference, (which are Pro Series have), or make sure your lights are shielded where you mount them.I have also seen where radios are earthed in the same vein as the headlights, so they can pick up the interference through the system.This is generally only affecting AM stations, and you will find that that it can increase the noise the further away from towns you get.You can also use radio suppressors on cabling lines, or use EMC decoders, (little match box size suppressors you can add to your cabling.In most cases, a good quality led light bar will have built-in EMC so you won t get this problem, but on some older vehicles, you might find a few p]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[3 Inch LED Work Lights. For a small work light these give off an amazing amount of light, even I m impressed. The 4D optics intensify the amount of light you get and it there are no dark spots or black lines that you get with some of the cheaper lights, which makes a big difference on what you actually see. The flood beam pattern angle is about 45 degrees and you get a good light over 100mtrs. My pick of the litter for a small led work light that actually is useful. Work Lights for Tractors, Trucks, or General Purpose Use. You can use these led lights for a range of applications, tractors, trucks, quad bikes, mining machines, on utes, and they only draw about 3amps so you can use existing wiring looms without having to modify or adapt anything. In comparison to halogen, you are getting twice as much light, using half the amount of power, and they will last 100x longer. A good investment for those wanting clearer vision, more light, and you won t have to change them every 5 minutes as they will last for years. Call us for free advice about your application, from cars to trucks, to mining and agricultural machinery, we have the expertise and solutions to help you get the right led light for what you need to achieve, and at the right price. A quick breakdown of the key features of the 3 40w led work lights.  Genuine High Intensity 10W LED s.  4000 Lumen Per Light, (twice as bright as standard halogen bulbs).  Durable Polycarbonate Lens, Vibration Resistant, and IP68 Weatherproofing.  Advanced 4D Lens Technology.  5500k Pure White for Maximum Optical Clarity.  Free and Fast Air Express Delivery.  Free Relay Harness Switch if Needed.  Heavy Duty Stainless Steel Brackets Bolts.  Australian Backed 5yr Warranty. My Pick as the Best Small LED Work Light at an Affordable Price ]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[High Powered HID Ballasts.The high-powered HID Ballasts are 100w and 12v compatible.Our 100w ballasts are absolute monsters in power output and will produce around 10,000 lumen each with the 100w bubs.Each 100w ballast are a multi-volt 9-32v ballast which means they are suitable for 12v or 24v vehicles.100 Watt Ballasts are generally used to upgrade driving lights and spotlights, but can also be used for high beam headlight ballast upgrades, as they still get to full brightness relatively quickly because of the high-quality chips in them.Our 100w ballasts have been carefully selected and tested to give you the best-engineered products available today. We have tried many 100w ballasts, (beware of fake ballasts claiming to be 120w or 150w, they are fake), and have found a lot of 100w ballasts to be unreliable, and they can cause serious problems to the vehicle.The 100w ballasts have a 5yr warranty and are a proven reliable and long-lasting solution for any heavy-duty or high-powered illumination requirements.

<description><![CDATA[Wireless GEN2 Quick-Fit Headlight Globes for Cars Trucks.The Quick-Fit GEN2 are the upgraded versions of our original quick-fit kits. Suitable for Cars, Trucks, Motorcycles, the latest quick-fit kits have had a major overhaul and their performance is outstanding.What I like about them most is that they are so easy to fit. Just pull out the old bulb, put the new quick-fit in, and that s it! No mounting drivers, no worries about tying down cabling, the GEN2 Quick fit are a true simple plug play unit. The other thing is the power, the Quick-Fit GEN2 are like putting in an HID, but without the Glare!If you are looking for a no-mess-no-fuss solution to brightening up your headlights then give the Quick-Fit GEN2 led globes a go. Plug Play Power! Quick-Fit GEN2 Overview Summary.CAN-BUS COMPATIBLE: In themselves, the quick-fit will work on 90% of vehicles as-is with no flicker, noise, or error codes. In some rare cases, you may need to add extra can-bus decoders which we can add to your kit for Free if they are needed. If you are not sure give us a call and we can go over it with you.HEADLIGHT TYPE COMPATIBILITY: The Quick-Fit GEN2 LED s are a super bright second generation led that will work in Reflector Lenses and are also suitable for the more advanced Projector Lenses.GEN2 LED S: The second generation Philips Luxeon Z ES chips now produce more lumen/watt and have a longer life with less illumination degradation over time. More light, a longer life, and better durability.PLUG PLAY: The Quick-Fit have built-in original termination points so that you can simply plug in your existing headlight connector just as you would with your original halogen bulb.COMPACT: Built to replace normal halogen bulbs, the quick-fit are no broader or deeper than your original globes, but are 3x brighter and last 100x longer.HYBRID COOLING TECHNOLOGY: The evolution of thermal management has gone from fans, to copper braids, to conduction and heat dissipation through the body. The latest hybrid cooling systems have now come full circle and have rolled the previous technologies into one. Convection is now through liquid + copper cores and thermally engineered aviation-grade aluminium bodies. Coupled with the intelligent temperature control system and virtually noiseless Japanese *smart fan technology, the Quick-Fit led headlight globes are kept relatively cool in any environment and will last for up to 100,000 hours with minimal light illumination degradation over time.Professional Grade.Pro Vision Lighting has been in the auto electrical supply industry for over 20yrs. Our quick-fit led globes are a high performance easy-to-fit led bulb that carries a 3-year warranty and a money-back guarantee.

In the case of Earth Switched Vehicles, (Negatively switched vehicles), you can get plug and play polarity converters and 50w resistors to solve polarity or load issues that some vehicles have, (if you are not sure, get your local auto electrician to check). **Note: By law, a qualified automotive electrician is required to do any electrical work to a vehicle. Not all vehicle electrical systems are created equal, so as professionals we advise that you get an auto electrician to fit your lights to alleviate any unforeseen variances your vehicles electrics may have.

<link><![CDATA[https://www.pro-vision-lighting.com/hid-spotlight-driving-light-4-inch-rt?language=en&amp;currency=AUD]]></link>
<description><![CDATA[4 Inch 55 Watt HID Spotlights and Driving Lights with Red Trim.Super powerful and a tried and tested performer, the 4 Inch 55W are available in a Spot, Euro (A euro beam is a driving beam. euro beams can be classed as a wide beam or spread beam), or you can get a combination of 1x spot and 1x euro. We have listed them for purchase Per Light, 1x light is One Piece, 2x lights will be a Pair. Some clients, like roo shooters, will only require one light to set up on their racks so we have this option for your convenience.What Do I Get With The Lights?Each light comes with everything you need and there are no hidden costs. You get a free relay harness and switch, the cost of freight is included in the price, you get free clear protective covers, and you get all the mounting brackets and accessories included with the lights.Why Better Engineering Matters.Some key requirements for the less expensive hid lights are that the housings are a high-grade ABS and that the components, (bulbs and ballasts), are good quality. There are cheaper lights available that look the same, but take it from us, there are a few problems that you cannot see from the outside.The first thing is the quality of the ABS. The material engineering has to be of a high grade so that the plastic is not too brittle or become brittle after exposure to sunlight. Most cheap products have bad material plastics that will not withstand harsher conditions over an extended period of time. We use a high-grade ABS housing that will withstand corrugated roads and withstand damaging UV radiation from the sun.The other couple of parts you don t see are the bulbs and ballasts. First of all, to get good current stability you need an AC/DC compatible ballast that has a good warranty, (ours are tried and tested and we give you a 3yr warranty on them). The ballasts are also critical for regulating the power to the bulbs correctly so as to give the globe an extended lifespan. The globes we use are UV Cut Quartz so as to not burn or damage reflectors and lenses, (low-grade globes make lenses smoky and reduce visibility and can also burn reflectors reducing there reflectivity). The xenon gas and pressure cylinders in an HID globe must be high grade so that the colour temperature remains stable and produce a consistent optically clear light. Quality globes last longer, give you better optical clarity and reduce eye fatigue.A quick breakdown of the key features of the 4 55W HID Driving Lights and Spotlights.Genuine ABS: Engineered to endure corrugated roads and UV protection against material break-down.Super Bright, Super-Efficient: Powerful internal AC/DC 55W HID Ballasts producing 5500 Lumen of light. Equal in brightness to a 225W halogen globe but only using the same amount of power as a 55w halogen bulb. More than 1km of illumination.Advanced Optical Clarity: Our globes are the latest high-grade xenon bulbs and are available in 4300k warm white or 6000k cool white. A stable lighting effect for better visual clarity and reducing eye fatigue.Size: 4 - H150x W145x D130mm.Voltage: 12v or 24v Available.Free and Fast Air Express Delivery: Generally within 2-3 weeks depending on location.Warranty: Australian Backed 3yr Warranty. Amazing Light Output for Their Size ]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Third Generation Extreme PLUS (P18 G3 Series) LED Headlight Globe Replacements. CAN-BUS COMPATIBILITY: The Extreme PLUS G3 Series (P18 - 18,000lm), have the latest engineering technology in their micro-drivers that are can-bus compatible in over 98% of vehicles with an automatic lighting system, (vehicles where your lights switch on automatically). The EXTP G3 are also compatible with all older vehicles that need more load resistance and all non can-bus controlled vehicles.BRIGHTNESS: Better illumination leads to a safer driving experience. The G3 produce an amazing 18,000 Lumen and are specially designed with the latest advances in optical engineering to produce a kelvin rating that is closest to midday sunlight. Scientists tell us that our eyes are best adapted to see the contrast of objects at around the midday sunlight spectrum. Modern optical lighting engineers are reproducing this midday sunlight kelvin rating in the latest and highest quality products to give you the best possible visible clarity when driving on or off the road at night. The other important factor for the G3 is that they are low glare, so even though they are technically brighter than a 35w HID bulb, they will not blind people coming the other way.EASY FIT PLUG PLAY: You don t have to worry about any re-wiring, cutting wires, or having to drill holes in your dust cap with the EXTP G3. Each bulb is custom designed to fit into the smallest of housings and plug straight into your existing headlight connector. The base is only 37.5mm in diameter and is only the same depth on the base as your old halogen bulbs, around 35mm, (H4 H/L are a bit bigger - 45mm deep). Also, the micro-driver is only 15mm thick, and built into the high heat rated cable, so you can easily tuck everything neatly inside the smallest automotive headlight cavities.HYBRID THERMAL MANAGEMENT: The evolution of thermal management has gone from fans, to copper braids, to conduction and heat dissipation through the body. The latest hybrid cooling systems have now come full circle and have rolled the previous technologies into one advanced system for maximum effect. Convection is now through liquid + copper cores and thermally engineered aviation grade aluminum bodies. Coupled with the intelligent temperature control system and virtually noiseless Japanese *smart fan technology, the G3 led bulbs are kept relatively cool in any environment and will last for up to 100,000 hours with minimal light degradation over time.G3 Extreme PLUS Professional Grade LED Headlight Bulb Solutions.Pro Vision Lighting has been in the auto electrical supply industry for over 20yrs. Our third generation extreme plus series are a high performance led headlight globe built for serious car enthusiasts and automotive professionals. The G3 carry a 3-year warranty and a money back guarantee.

<description><![CDATA[H4 H/L LED Polarity Converter for Headlights.The polarity converters make it so much easier than having to re-wire your headlights original wiring.Converting earth switched vehicles headlight wiring when you upgrade older vehicle headlights, such as Hilux and Landcruiser, (around 98-2005), is a lot easier now thanks to the universal polarity converters.Earth switched vehicles are kind of not normal , in that the headlights H4 H/L connector has a common terminal, low beam terminal - earth, high beam terminal - earth. An actively switched H4 headlight connector has earth, active low beam, and active high beam, (Over 80 out of 100 sales of our led headlights have not needed polarity converters).If you are not sure if you need polarity converters, get your local auto electrician to check your electrical system to be certain.

HYBRID THERMAL TECHNOLOGY FOR A LONG LIFE IN ANY ENVIRONMENT: The evolution of thermal management has gone from fans, to copper braids, to conduction and heat dissipation through the body.The G3 have the latest hybrid cooling system.Thermal management has now come full circle, rolling all the previous technologies into one advanced system for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.Convection has now advanced tremendously with the G3 s liquid + copper cores and thermally engineered aviation-grade aluminium bodies.Coupled with the intelligent temperature control system and noiseless Japanese *Smart Fan technology, the G3 led bulbs are kept cool in any environment and will last for up to 100,000 hours with minimal light degradation over time.

In the case of Earth Switched Vehicles, (Negatively switched vehicles), you can get plug-and-play polarity converters and 50w resistors to solve polarity or load issues that some vehicles have, (if you are not sure, get your local auto electrician to check). **Note: By law, a qualified automotive electrician is required to do any electrical work to a vehicle. Not all vehicle electrical systems are created equal, so as professionals we advise that you get an auto electrician to fit your lights to alleviate any unforeseen variances your vehicle s electrics may have.TIPS FOR FITTING LED HEADLIGHTSCheck these tips before buying led headlights.

EMC and Can-Bus Decoders are built-in for suppressing electromagnetic interference and for working with automatic headlight functions or for standard drop-ins. The latest advanced optics are beautifully engineered for high brightness but with low glare, so they will not impede passing motorists on low beam.

The Ranger can handle any environment or terrain. It comprises a virtually unbreakable and scratch-proof Polycarbonate lens, and is IP67 rated with military-style breathers for full environmental protection and maintenance.
