<g:description>*** Director Pick***&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Best All-round.

The X8 Pro have excellent heat dissipation properties and brightness. This allows maximum illumination while prolonging the life of the led&amp;apos;s and reducing the loss of the light, (dimming), over it&amp;apos;s lifetime.
The external micro drivers create a much more stable current for better compatibility with the vehicles electrical system. 
The advanced conduction and heat-sink also adds to the life and quality of the product but does not heat up the base significantly enough to burn rubber or plastic housings as some led headlight bulbs do.
The X8 Pro are compact enough to fit any headlight housing as they are only 34mm (H4 H/L) from the mounting seat to the bottom of the light, matching perfectly with original H4 H/L halogen bulbs.
The X8&amp;apos;s have a 360° rotatable base so you can perfectly adjust the beam pattern to suit any headlight reflectors.
**Please Note** Can-Bus decoders are only required if you have an &amp;quot;auto light on&amp;quot; system, such as BMW and Mercedes.
  Features:
* Fanless and Non-Polarity Sensitive, (for positive and negatively switched vehicles).
* Advanced Fanless Heat Dissipation and Aviation Grade 6063 Aluminum.
* 360° Fully Adjustable Beam Rotation Technology.
* Double Sided LED&amp;apos;s for better optics.
* Easy Fit “Plug and Play” OEM Headlight Connector.
* Super Bright – Up to 12,000 Lumen, (H+L).
* 9-32v Wide voltage, 12v/24v Compatible for Cars, Trucks, and Motorcycles.
* IP67 Water and Dust Tight.
* Colour Options: Pure White + 2x Included &amp;quot;DIY&amp;quot; Gold and Blue Colour Films.</g:description>

<g:description>9 Inch 370 Watt LED Driving Light.The 9&amp;quot; 370w are engineered with the latest 5D Hybrid Lenses. The hybrid lenses are a combination of parabolic and optical lens technology that maximizes the distance and the width of the light beam without compromising on light efficacy, or the amount of light that gets through the lenses and onto the road where you need it the most.The slim design is also heavy duty and efficient, they are able to be used on smaller bars that have limited room from the grill to the mounting holes, the brackets are suitable for shock, they are ingress rated at IP68 for harsh environments and creek crossings. The electronics are engineered to maximise the life of the led&amp;apos;s and put out the maximum amount of light without the loss of illumination. Other products start to fade over a short period of time due to overheating and over-driving the led&amp;apos;s.The 370w are the most powerful and technologically advanced led driving lights in the world today.(Beware of suppliers that are selling lights claiming to be a higher wattage output than these, they are lying, if there were any, we would have them).Note*** These lights are absolutely awesome when coupled with our EXTREME Series LED Light Bars, you will never need any other lighting with this set-up, and it is highly recommended from our professional drivers, and off-road 4WD shops.

They are a perfect fit for bull bars where there is not much room, and are a great complimentary light for using with spot lights to fill in the side areas of a vehicle, and to light immediately in front of the vehicle, and forward to the outer limits in distance.The mounts are an easy fit base mount which are on a slide rail. They are able to be moved into the position of pre-existing holes in your bull bar.The advanced drivers allow for low current draw with high light output, so even though they are technically powerful in wattage, they use up to 2/3 of the current as some other lights.&amp;quot;Best Light Coverage for their Size!</g:description>

Having the ability to adjust the rigid side mounts gives the fitter an ability to &amp;quot;extend&amp;quot; the length of the light bar to suit the mounting placement, and not have to worry about if the lightbar is too long, or too short, for where you want to mount it. Don&amp;apos;t forget, you have an L Foot side mount option or a base mount on a slide rail option too.This is not all, the USA Made CREE XML-2 led&amp;apos;s are probably the best led&amp;apos;s on the planet in terms of brightness and heat resistance, this means the are brighter per led, and last over 50,000hrs, even in the middle of the desert.The reflectors in the pro-series are another added advantage, especially in a &amp;quot;combination beam&amp;quot;, (Spot/Flood), as the parabolic reflectors of the pro series are the best in it&amp;apos;s class, and produce the perfect distance plus width combination  making them a perfect driving light.Complete with the highest IP68 environmental control, and advanced thermal management, the pro series light bars are an all-round favorite for high/low temp environments like on long highways in the outback, or in high/low altitudes like in the snowy mountains.&amp;quot;My Favorite &amp;quot;Combo&amp;quot; Beam Light!</g:description>

<g:product_type>LED &gt; LED Headlight Bulbs. For Cars, Trucks, and Motorcycles.</g:product_type>
<g:description>Best for Motorcycles and small headlight housings, In-Built Drivers.


The ATOM have built-in drivers so that you don&amp;apos;t have to worry about mounting the external driver types. This is particularly handy when you have no room to mount external drivers, or have very small headlight housings.
The ATOM is also Fan-Less which means the conduction is drawn away from the led and into the body of the bulb, but it is also cool enough as not to burn plastic caps and rubber seals if it touches them.
The ATOM have a 360° rotatable base so that you can adjust the beam pattern perfectly to suit your type of headlight housing.
**Please Note** Can-Bus decoders are only required if you have an &amp;quot;auto light on&amp;quot; system, such as BMW and Mercedes.
  Features:
* Fan-Less and Non-Polarity Sensitive, (for positive and negatively switched vehicles).
* Advanced Heat Dissipation with Aviation Grade 6063 Aluminum.
* 360° Fully Adjustable Beam Rotation Technology.
* Double Sided LED&amp;apos;s for better optics and more light.
* Easy Fit “Plug and Play” OEM Headlight Connector.
* Super Bright – Up to 10,000 Lumen, (H+L).
* 9-32v Wide voltage, 12v/24v Compatible for Cars, Trucks, and Motorcycles.
* IP67 Water and Dust Tight.
* Colour Options: Pure White + 2x Included &amp;quot;DIY&amp;quot; Gold and Blue Colour Films.</g:description>

This sensor comes with the kit and is able to be used if desired as an auto dimming sensor that detects oncoming vehicles lights and dims the light &amp;nbsp;bar to around 25% power. Handy for when there is a lot of traffic on the highway and you are constantly turning the lights on and off.If your looking for a &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; light bar that is truly exceptional, i can guarantee 100% that you will be happy you chose out the 6D Dual Row, as it is an outstanding led light bar.</g:description>

<g:product_type>LED &gt; LED Light Bars. Straight, Curved, Single, Dual, Triple, Quad, and Slim. &gt; E36 CURVED LED Light Bar. | Classic Style and Powerful.</g:product_type>
<g:description>E36 22&amp;quot; 120w Curved Double Row LED Light Bar.
The arc on the E36 allows for a broader beam of light than standard lightbars. This coupled as a dual row and with an aerodynamically engineered classic design, gives you more depth of light and low noise. The E36 are only 78mm high and 88mm deep, so they are still slim enough to look fantastic on roof-racks.EMC and RF compatible electronics give you no interference and the dual 3w USA Made CREE XB-D led&amp;apos;s, (128lm/w), give the E36 a low power consumption, a high light output onto the road, exceptional thermal management, and a life of over 50,000hrs of continual use.
The heavy duty brackets are a fully adjustable fastening system designed for off-road 4x4 use or when driving on heavily corrugated dirt roads.
In terms of light &amp;quot;on-the-road&amp;quot; the E36 gives you the best of both worlds by giving you a good wide spread + distance + depth, and in terms of water, dust, and vibration, the E36 is able to be used for off-road four wheel driving, or on mining and farming machinery, withstanding any harsh environments that are thrown at it.
The price of the E36 is low for a high quality lightbar so we give it a big &amp;quot;thumbs-up&amp;quot; for performance, price, functionality, design, and durability.</g:description>

<g:description>6 Inch 30 Watt Professional Grade LED Light Bar.The new multi-bracket system has some unique features that make the pro series lightbars an attractive choice for savvy buyers. Having the ability to adjust the rigid side mounts gives the fitter an ability to &amp;quot;extend&amp;quot; the length of the light bar to suit the mounting placement, and not have to worry about if the lightbar is too long, or too short, for where you want to mount it. Don&amp;apos;t forget, you have an L Foot side mount option or a base mount on a slide rail option too.This is not all, the USA Made CREE XML-2 led&amp;apos;s are probably the best led&amp;apos;s on the planet in terms of brightness and heat resistance, this means the are brighter per led, and last over 50,000hrs, even in the middle of the desert.The reflectors in the pro-series are another added advantage, especially in a &amp;quot;combination beam&amp;quot;, (Spot/Flood), as the parabolic reflectors of the pro series are the best in it&amp;apos;s class, and produce the perfect distance plus width combination  making them a perfect driving light.Complete with the highest IP68 environmental control, and advanced thermal management, the pro series light bars are an all-round favorite for high/low temp environments like on long highways in the outback, or in high/low altitudes like in the snowy mountains.&amp;quot;My Favorite &amp;quot;Combo&amp;quot; Beam Light!</g:description>

<g:description>High Powered HID Ballasts.The high powered HID Ballasts come in the 70w Fast Start and the 100w.Our 100w ballasts are absolute monsters in power output and will produce around 10,000 lumen each with the 100w bubs.The 70w are a fast start ballast which means the are almost instantaneous to full brightness.Each 100w ballast are a multi-volt 9-32v ballast which means they are suitable for 12v or 24v vehicles, and the 70w are suitable for 12v applications.100 Watt Ballasts are generally used to upgrade driving lights and spot lights, but can also be used for high beam headlight ballast upgrades, as they still get to full brightness relatively quickly because of the high quality chips in them.The 70w can be used for high beams because the &amp;quot;fast start&amp;quot; properties enable them to be almost instantaneous to full brightness, which is helpful when switching from high beam to low beam in oncoming traffic, and then switching them back up to high beam and get full brightness instantaneously.Our 70w and 100w ballasts have been carefully selected and tested to give you the best engineered products available today. We have tried many 70w and 100w ballasts, (beware of fake ballasts claiming to be 120w or 150w, they are fake), and have found a lot of 70w and 100w ballasts to be unreliable, and they can cause serious problems to the vehicle.The 70w and 100w ballasts have a 5yr warranty, and are a proven reliable and long lasting solution for any heavy duty or high powered illumination requirements.&amp;quot;Super Bright!, Super Reliable&amp;quot;</g:description>

<g:product_type>LED &gt; LED Headlight Bulbs. For Cars, Trucks, and Motorcycles.</g:product_type>
<g:description>H7 Limited Time Special. Built Drivers.


The ATOM have built-in drivers so that you don&amp;apos;t have to worry about mounting the external driver types. This is particularly handy when you have no room to mount external drivers, or have very small headlight housings.
The ATOM is also Fan-Less which means the conduction is drawn away from the led and into the body of the bulb, but it is also cool enough as not to burn plastic caps and rubber seals if it touches them.
The ATOM have a 360° rotatable base so that you can adjust the beam pattern perfectly to suit your type of headlight housing.
**Please Note** Can-Bus decoders are only required if you have an &amp;quot;auto light on&amp;quot; system, such as BMW and Mercedes.
  Features:
* Fan-Less and Non-Polarity Sensitive, (for positive and negatively switched vehicles).
* Advanced Heat Dissipation with Aviation Grade 6063 Aluminum.
* 360° Fully Adjustable Beam Rotation Technology.
* Double Sided LED&amp;apos;s for better optics and more light.
* Easy Fit “Plug and Play” OEM Headlight Connector.
* Super Bright – Up to 10,000 Lumen, (H+L).
* 9-32v Wide voltage, 12v/24v Compatible for Cars, Trucks, and Motorcycles.
* IP67 Water and Dust Tight.
* Colour Options: Pure White + 2x Included &amp;quot;DIY&amp;quot; Gold and Blue Colour Films.</g:description>

<g:description>22 Inch 384 Watt F1 Phantom LED Light Bar.
The 22&amp;quot; F1 Phantom are available in a straight or curved configuration.
Although the 22&amp;quot; is very powerful at 384w, the current draw is only around 20amps so they can be used on general lighting systems without any modifications.
The lights come with free extras, including a high quality relay harness and rocker switch, and you can get other free extras such as bar clamps or high beam adapters upon request.
The price also includes free air express freight world-wide.
The F1 Phantom utilize the latest hybrid lens technology combining advanced flood + spot optics. The unique design maximizes distance + width + depth, making the F1 Phantom the best all-round led light bar for 2018.
The F1 Phantom Series are also extremely compact and easy to fit as they are only 78mm high on the vertical face.
With the ability to do the job of 6x lights in one, the F1 Phantom are the best value for money. For the 32&amp;quot;, 42&amp;quot;, and 52&amp;quot; you get the equivalent of having 2x spotlights, 2x euro lights, and 2x flood lights. The design creates distance, width, and depth, making the F1 Phantom a versatile led light bar able to be used on cars, trucks, farming machinery, and mining vehicles.
Technically speaking, the F1 Phantom have an aerodynamically engineered light-weight aluminum housing, military breathers for pressure equalization, are IP68 water and dust proof for complete environmental protection, and are fitted with Premium A Grade USA Made CREE XB-D Optical led&amp;apos;s for a high powered light output, high efficiency with low power consumption, and a long life without led degradation over a short period of time.

After rigorous testing, I put the 32&amp;quot; F1 Phantom on my own vehicle. Have a look at the images in the thumbnails to give you an idea of what a real light bars light output should look like.

&amp;quot;My personal pick as the best all-round light bar i have seen for 2018&amp;quot;</g:description>

After rigorous testing, I put the 32&amp;quot; F1 Phantom on my own vehicle. Have a look at the images in the thumbnails to give you an idea of what a real light bars light output should look like.

&amp;quot;My personal pick as the best all-round light bar i have seen for 2018&amp;quot;</g:description>

<g:description>52 Inch 924 Watt F1 Phantom LED Light Bar.
The 52&amp;quot; F1 Phantom are available in a straight or curved configuration.
Although the 52&amp;quot; is very powerful at 924w, the current draw is only around 50amps so they can be used on general lighting systems without any modifications.
The lights come with free extras, including a high quality relay harness and rocker switch, and you can get other free extras such as bar clamps or high beam adapters upon request.
The price also includes free air express freight world-wide.
The F1 Phantom utilize the latest hybrid lens technology combining advanced flood + spot optics. The unique design maximizes distance + width + depth, making the F1 Phantom the best all-round led light bar for 2018.
The F1 Phantom Series are also extremely compact and easy to fit as they are only 78mm high on the vertical face.
With the ability to do the job of 6x lights in one, the F1 Phantom are the best value for money. For the 32&amp;quot;, 42&amp;quot;, and 52&amp;quot; you get the equivalent of having 2x spotlights, 2x euro lights, and 2x flood lights. The design creates distance, width, and depth, making the F1 Phantom a versatile led light bar able to be used on cars, trucks, farming machinery, and mining vehicles.
Technically speaking, the F1 Phantom have an aerodynamically engineered light-weight aluminum housing, military breathers for pressure equalization, are IP68 water and dust proof for complete environmental protection, and are fitted with Premium A Grade USA Made CREE XB-D Optical led&amp;apos;s for a high powered light output, high efficiency with low power consumption, and a long life without led degradation over a short period of time.

<g:product_type>LED &gt; LED Light Bars. Straight, Curved, Single, Dual, Triple, Quad, and Slim. &gt; E5-X Curved &amp; Straight LED Light Bars. Single Row Slim-Line Design.</g:product_type>
<g:description>CURVED 43 Inch 210 Watt Slim Line LED Light Bar.The E5-X 43&amp;quot; Slim Line Light Bars are powerful, stylish, heavy duty, and have a 5 Degree Camber (Curve/Arc), which gives you that extra beam width when your driving on country roads at night.Included in the price is Express Air delivery worldwide, a relay harness and switch, and we have other extras available upon request if needed.Utilizing the latest hybrid lens technology, which combines parabolic reflectors and optical lenses, the E5-X gives you excellent light coverage, (in distance and width), and you get them with the option of having all spot, all flood, or a combination of spot and flood. The advanced slim design allows them to be fitted without any air-flow impedance, and even though are only 41mm high on the face, they still retain maximum light efficacy on the road., (they&amp;apos;re bright for a small light bar).The E5-X are also suitable to be fitted into grill slots very easily, or on bars and roof racks.Technically speaking, the E5-X have an aerodynamically engineered light-weight aluminium housing, are IP67 water and dust proof for complete environmental protection, have high vibratory shock absorption technology, a virtually unbreakable PMMA Lens, hybrid optical + parabolic lens technology, and are fitted with Premium Grade A, USA Made, CREE XT-E Optical led&amp;apos;s, (178lm/W).Built to last, the E5-X will give you maximum light output, are highly efficient and have a low power consumption, and they have a long life without any led degradation over a short period of time.&amp;quot;My personal pick as the best slim-line light bar that doesn&amp;apos;t compromise on light output&amp;quot;</g:description>
